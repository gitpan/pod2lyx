    - Added usage output from pod2lyx.
    - Added pod documentation to pod2lyx.
    - Moved ToDo list out of the README file and put in the TODO file.

        ExtUtils::MakeMaker to see what I mean as it puts all kinds of stuff
        in a list.
    - Added the ability to handle multilevel lists.
    - Added the ability to automaticly place a pagebreak after the contents.
        See pod2lyx -help for information on how to do this.
