This package contains two things a perl class called Pod::Lyx and a wraper for
that class called pod2lyx. As the name implies this package will convert perl
pod documentation into a format readable by LyX ( see http://www.lyx.org for
information on LyX ).

Why did I write this?

I really wanted a good way to print pod documentation where I could control
certin aspects of the process. I'm sure some of you are saying that their are
already ways of doing this. True there are, but they didn't produce the results
I wanted. And I have used LyX for various things in the past and thought to
myself that I could get what I wanted out of LyX if I could just get the pod
documentation into LyX. So I created this package to do the pod to LyX
conversion stuff. Now I can use LyX to get the results I want. So I'm happy
for now that is. This converter as it stands is lacking many things but
it will do 95% of the work for me or you if you decide to use it. I do hope I
will be able to get the converter to do more of the work later thus reducing
the amount of time I/you have to spend tweeking little bits here and their to
get the results I/we want.


How to install the package?

perl Makefile.PL
make
make install

Thats it you are ready to go.

How do I use this thing?

1) You have a pod file in the current directory that you want to convert.

pod2lyx podfile.pod
pod2lxy perlwithpod.pl
pod2lyx perlmodule.pm

2) You have a pod file in some directory that you want to convert.

pod2lyx somedir/podfile.[whatever]

3) You want to convert a pod file shipped with Perl.

pod2lyx perlpod         # don't put an extention on pod documentation that
                        # is distributed with perl.

4) You want to extract the pod documentation from an installed module or script.

pod2lyx Pod::Lyx    # note this will not produce any thing at this time because
                    # Pod::Lyx does not contain any pod documentation yet :(

pod2lyx open        # this will extract the pod documentation out of the first
                    # open.* match. Other wise if you have installed a open.pl
                    # and a open.pm and they both contain pod data the first
                    # one found will be converted. NOTE: If you were to have
                    # something like File/open.pm installed this will not match
                    # because it is not at the same level in the module tree.

5) To get a list of the availible options.

pod2lyx -help           # brief help screen
pod2lyx -man            # more in depth help screen.


Things that eather are not implemented or don't work as expected:

1) E<escapecode> is not converted.
2) C< soemthing B<something> something > does not work correctly. The output
      will contain one to many spaces.

Also there are some pod's that just don't quite look right when conveted to the
LyX format but with each release this is getting better.


Bugs:
1) I'm sure there are some of them but I ran out of Raid so I'll just have to
    deal with them as they come up.

Contact:

For now use my main mail account richardj@1gig.net. I do monitor the lyx-users
list so if you post something there I will mostlikly find it. When sending me
something please put pod2lyx in the header so I don't just delete it when I
clean out my mail box. Also if you don't mind drop me a note if you find this
usfull.
